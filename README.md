Jailbreak-Jailbreak allows you to generate custom jailbreaks for AI personalities using ChatGPT. Jailbreaks are configurations that tailor ChatGPT's behavior. This generator supports pre-defined jailbreaks.

## 2. Getting Started

Before you begin, have your OpenAI Token ready for API access.

### OpenAI Token

You need an OpenAI Token to access the GPT-3.5 API. Input your token when starting the jailbreak generator.

## 3. Generating Jailbreaks

### Creating a Jailbreak

Provide a consistent prompt defining the behavior. Include the jailbreak name and base jailbreak. Example prompt:

`Generate a jailbreak named RebelAis based on the LittleGPT Jailbreak ðŸ”’`
