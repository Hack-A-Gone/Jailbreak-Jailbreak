## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Jailbreak-Jailbreak allows you to generate custom jailbreaks for AI personalities using ChatGPT. Jailbreaks are configurations that tailor ChatGPT's behavior. This generator supports pre-defined jailbreaks.

### What is a jailbreak? <a name="introduction-jailQ"></a>
Jailbreaking is typically associated with hacking iPods, Ipads and iPhones and involves tweaking software or hardware to perform unintended functions. In ChatGPTâ€™s case, it means making it respond to queries it is supposed to avoid, for example swear, or generate unethical text.

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

Before you begin, have your OpenAI Token ready for API access.

### OpenAI Token <a name="openai-token"></a>

You need an OpenAI Token to access the GPT-3.5 API. Input your token when starting the jailbreak generator.

## Generating Jailbreaks <a name="generating-jailbreaks"></a>

### Creating a Jailbreak <a name="creating-a-jailbreak"></a>

Provide a consistent prompt defining the behavior. Include the jailbreak name and base jailbreak. Example prompt:

`Generate a jailbreak named RebelAis based on the LittleGPT Jailbreak`
